Welcome to the "A True Companion" guide. This is a guide aimed to help you get started with creating a custom follower for Skyrim Special Edition and to help you maintain & troubleshoot it. You will learn how to create a custom follower from scratch, including the follower framework, AI packages and best practices.

Here you will find reference lists to the most common features of any follower mod and how to implement them. You will also find a list of common issues and how to troubleshoot them.

## Why this guide is necessary

There is a lot of good resources out there for the Creation Kit, for creating followers and for generally anything. Most of these come in video format, which means they are usually outdated and doesn't follow current best practices. A written guide is more comprehensive, it's easier to update & maintain and it can include all of the details that a video most likely will miss.

This aim to gather everything you need to know about creating a follower in one place, so you don't have to search around for hours to find the information you need.

## Why you should create a follower

Besides being a fun endeavour, it's the perfect gateway into modding. You will learn and get comfortable with Papyrus scripting, setting up & writing narratives & dialogue, work with quests, packages, voice acting, recording and editing, and much more. All of these are necessary skills for creating any kind of mod. The Creation Kit can be a bit complicated to work with, and while the Creation Kit wiki is a good resource, it's also quite barebones.
