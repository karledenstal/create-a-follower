description: What you need to know before you start.

Before you can start creating your follow, you will need to set up the Creation Kit, your development environment and necessary fixes.

This guide will use the latest version of Skyrim Special Edition (`1.6.640`) and the Creation Kit (`1.6.438`). The paid `Anniversary Edition` DLC is not required.

We will assume that you are comfortable with modding Skyrim and have the necessary setup for this. If you are not, we recommend you start looking at a modding guide before diving into mod creation.

Good things to know about the guide before you start:

- We use Steam.
- We use [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) as our mod manager.
- We use [xEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164).
